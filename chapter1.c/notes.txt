1.1 Algorithms

    The best way to understand a proposed algorithm is to work through
    it with a pen and paper.
    
    Five features of an algorithm:
        1. Finiteness    - An algorithm must terminate after a finite number
                           of steps.
        2. Definiteness  - Each step of an algorithm must be precisely
                          defined. Needs to be specific.
        3. Input         - An algorithm has zero, or more inputs.
        4. Output        - An algorithm will always have one, or more outputs.
        5. Effectiveness - Generally, an algorithm is expected to be effective;
                           meaning, that they must be possible to execute by
                           someone in a finite amount of time on pen and paper.
                           
    An algorithm is like a cook book, if you take certain ingredients, follow
    specific instructions with them, you will get something to eat out of it.
