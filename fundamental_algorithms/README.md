notes on fundamental algorithms, the art of computer programming, vol. 1, knuth.

i am trying to solve the exercises in c.

rules for the code: 
    1. only aloud 3 indents max (3 nested blocks max).
    2. variable names must be good, use what the book says
        --> if you make your own variable names, make them good...
    3. make code readable to the point where you don't need comments.
